<p>The Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm, allowing certain steps of the algorithm to be implemented by subclasses. In C#, this pattern is commonly implemented using abstract methods and abstract classes.</p>
<br>
<p>As an ilustrative example we will work with Taxes. Based base on a particular condition each Tax should return the maximum or minimal tax rate.</p>

<!-- ## Examples of Using the Template Method Pattern -->

<p>The Template Method pattern is versatile and can be applied in various scenarios where you want to define the overall structure of an algorithm but allow specific parts to be implemented by subclasses. Besides tax classes, here are some common scenarios where the Template Method pattern can be beneficial:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Document Processing:</strong>
    <p>An algorithm for processing documents with common steps like reading, validating, and formatting, but specific implementations may vary for different document types.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Network Configuration:</strong>
    <p>A network configuration process involving common steps like establishing a connection and authentication, but specific configuration steps may vary for different network types (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc.).</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Game Development:</strong>
    <p>In game development, where a game event processing algorithm includes common steps like input processing, logic update, and rendering, but the specific game logic may vary.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Report Generation:</strong>
    <p>Generating reports with a common structure for data retrieval, formatting, and output generation, but specific logic for different types of reports may differ.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Component Lifecycle:</strong>
    <p>In systems dealing with components or services with complex lifecycles, the Template Method pattern can define common lifecycle steps.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Order Processing in E-commerce:</strong>
    <p>A system processing orders with common steps like inventory verification, final price calculation, and applying discounts, but specific product logic may vary.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Workflow Management:</strong>
    <p>In systems involving workflows, the Template Method pattern can define a general structure with common steps and specific logic for each step implemented by subclasses.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Code Compilation:</strong>
    <p>During the code compilation process, where common steps like lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, and intermediate code generation are shared, but the final code generation may vary for different target languages.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These examples showcase the flexibility and usefulness of the Template Method pattern in scenarios where a general structure needs to be defined, but specific parts should be customized by subclasses.</p>
