<p>The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a way to construct complex objects step by step. It allows a client to build a composite object, such as a product, sequentially without having to know the internal details of the construction.</p>
<br>
<p>As an ilustrative example we will work with Invoice.</p>

<!-- ## Examples of Using the Builder Pattern -->

<p>The Builder pattern is suitable in situations where the construction of an object is complex and involves multiple steps. Here are some examples of situations where the Builder pattern can be useful:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>HTML Document Construction:</strong>
    <p>When building HTML documents, especially when dealing with nested elements and optional attributes, the Builder pattern can be used to create an HTML structure more flexibly.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Graphic Object Configuration:</strong>
    <p>In applications involving graphics or design, the Builder can be employed to configure properties such as color, size, and style incrementally.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Product Configuration Assembly:</strong>
    <p>When a product has various configuration options and features, such as a car with color options, safety packages, etc., the Builder can facilitate the creation of these configurations.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Custom Report Generation:</strong>
    <p>When generating reports where the user can choose which sections to include, the Builder can be used to construct the report according to user preferences.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Database Connection Object Configuration:</strong>
    <p>In database systems, where connection configuration may involve multiple parameters, the Builder can be helpful in building clear connection configuration objects.</p>
  </li>

  <!-- Add more examples as needed -->

</ol>

<p>These are just a few examples, and the Builder pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where object construction is complex and involves different combinations of parameters. It provides a flexible and encapsulated way to create objects.</p>
