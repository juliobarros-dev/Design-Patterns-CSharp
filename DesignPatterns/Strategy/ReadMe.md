<p>We will employ the Strategy Pattern to address the challenge of managing similar classes with minor behavioral differences. This approach helps prevent code duplication, facilitating code maintenance and scalability.</p>
<br>
<p>As an illustrative example, we will focus on taxes, as it is common to encounter numerous taxes with varying values.</p>

<!-- ## Examples of Using the Strategy Pattern -->

<p>The Strategy pattern is versatile and can be applied in various situations beyond a tax calculator. Here are some examples of situations where the Strategy Pattern can be useful:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Sorting Lists:</strong>
    <p>If your application needs to sort lists in different ways (e.g., by date, by value, by name), the Strategy Pattern allows you to define different sorting strategies and apply them dynamically.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Database Connections:</strong>
    <p>When your application needs to connect to different types of databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB), the Strategy Pattern can be used to encapsulate specific connection logic in different classes.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Data Validation:</strong>
    <p>In a data validation system, you may have different validation strategies for different types of input. The Strategy Pattern allows you to dynamically choose the validation strategy to apply.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Report Generation:</strong>
    <p>If you're developing a system that generates reports, the Strategy Pattern can be used to define different report generation strategies, such as PDF, CSV, or HTML.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>File Compression:</strong>
    <p>When dealing with file compression operations, different compression algorithms can be encapsulated in separate strategies using the Strategy Pattern.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>User Authentication Systems:</strong>
    <p>In an authentication system, you may have different authentication strategies, such as password login, biometric authentication, or two-factor authentication, encapsulated as strategies.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Games:</strong>
    <p>In games, the Strategy Pattern can be applied to define behavior strategies for characters or units, allowing easy extension of new behaviors without modifying existing code.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Image Processing:</strong>
    <p>If you're building an image processing application, different processing algorithms (such as filtering, color correction) can be implemented as strategies.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These are just a few examples; the Strategy Pattern is a powerful tool for handling situations where different algorithms or behaviors can be applied dynamically at runtime.</p>
