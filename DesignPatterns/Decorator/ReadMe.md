<p>The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. </p>
<br>
<p>As an ilustrative example we will work with Tax domain</p>

<!-- ## Examples of Using the Decorator Pattern -->

<p>The Decorator Pattern is versatile and can be applied in various scenarios to add or modify functionality in a flexible and extensible way. Beyond tax classes, here are examples of situations where the Decorator Pattern can be beneficial:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Authentication in Systems:</strong>
    <p>Use the Decorator Pattern to add authentication features to different parts of a system without modifying their core logic.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Data Compression:</strong>
    <p>When dealing with I/O operations, apply decorators to add compression to files or data streams.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Text Formatting in GUI:</strong>
    <p>In graphical user interfaces, use decorators to add additional formatting to text components, such as font, color, or style.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Logging Operations:</strong>
    <p>Add logging functionalities to specific methods or operations without altering the original behavior.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Data Encryption in Network Communication:</strong>
    <p>Apply decorators to add encryption layers to network communication objects.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Access Control in Systems:</strong>
    <p>Add access control checks (e.g., permission verification) to specific parts of a system without modifying existing code.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Result Caching:</strong>
    <p>For optimization purposes, use decorators to add caching to methods, storing previous results to avoid recalculations.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Filters in Search Systems:</strong>
    <p>In search systems, apply decorators to add specific filters (e.g., date filtering, type filtering) to search results.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Notifications in Systems:</strong>
    <p>Add notification features to different parts of a system without interfering with the core logic.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Image Manipulation:</strong>
    <p>In image processing, decorators can be used to add filters or effects to a base image.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Remember that the Decorator Pattern is particularly useful when you have a set of basic functionalities (components) and want to add or modify these functionalities in a flexible and extensible manner.</p>
