<p>The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. </p>
<br>
<p>As an ilustrative example we will explore discounts based on the order's state</p>

<!-- ## Examples of Using the State Pattern -->

<p>Besides discount classes, the State pattern can be applied in various situations where an object can change its behavior based on its internal state. Here are some examples of situations where the State pattern can be beneficial:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Embedded Systems State Machines:</strong>
    <p>In embedded systems, such as robot control or electronic devices, the State pattern can be used to model different operational states.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Order Processing in E-commerce:</strong>
    <p>In an e-commerce system, an order can go through different states, such as "Waiting for Payment," "Processing," "Shipped," etc.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Document Control in Office Applications:</strong>
    <p>Text processing applications or document editors can use the State pattern to manage different editing modes, such as insertion, selection, or deletion.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Authentication System Access Levels:</strong>
    <p>Authentication systems with different access levels can use the State pattern to model the system's behavior based on the authenticated user.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Multiple Character States in Games:</strong>
    <p>In games, characters can have different states, such as "Attacking," "Defending," "Resting," and the State pattern can be used to manage these states.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Banking System Transaction Control:</strong>
    <p>Banking systems dealing with transactions can use the State pattern to model the state of a transaction (pending, confirmed, canceled, etc.).</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Reservation Systems in Airlines or Hotels:</strong>
    <p>In reservation systems, the State pattern can be applied to manage different reservation states, such as "Open," "Confirmed," "Canceled," etc.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Automatic Coffee Machines:</strong>
    <p>Automatic coffee machines can have different states, such as "Heating," "Brewing Coffee," "Waiting for Coffee Refill," and the State pattern can model these states.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Media Player Playback Control:</strong>
    <p>In media players, the State pattern can be used to manage different playback states, such as "Paused," "Playing," "Stopped," etc.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Networked Application Connection Management:</strong>
    <p>In networked applications, the State pattern can be employed to manage different connection states, such as "Connected," "Disconnected," "Waiting for Connection," etc.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These are just a few examples, and, in general, the State pattern is applicable whenever an object can change its behavior based on its internal state. It provides an organized and extensible way to handle state logic in a system.</p>
